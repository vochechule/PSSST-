### PSSST! Game

This project is a remake of the classic game **PSSST!** developed using C# and WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation).

### Description

In **PSSST!**, the player controls a character whose objective is to protect a growing flower from worms. The character can move around the grid and shoot projectiles to destroy the worms. The flower grows over time, and the game ends when the flower's health reaches zero or it reaches its full height.

### Gameplay Features

- **Character Control**: Move the character using the arrow keys and shoot projectiles with the spacebar.
- **Flower Growth**: The flower stem grows over time and must be protected from the worms.
- **Worms**: Worms spawn periodically and move towards the flower, trying to damage it.
- **Score**: Destroying worms increases the player's score.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the flower's health is depleted or it fully grows.

Enjoy playing and protecting your flower!
